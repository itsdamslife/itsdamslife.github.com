## Side Projects

`Recipe web app`

I started this developing this app to learn and understand basics of web development and intricacies of server-client. I used MEAN stack for this product. I was successful in implementing a web server which serves POST, GET, PUT and DELETE methods to add, read, modify and delete recipes. I also developed a generic front end using Angular which can be used for basic blogging and apps like this recipe.

Yet to do: Integrate this server part and the front end, add authentication using passport.js to make it end-to-end usable.
