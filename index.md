## Side Projects

`Android app`

Currently working on an Android app just to learn and understand the basics of the platform. Integrate with firebase SDK and provide mobile front-end to the web-app side projects I had done.

Yet to do: First will take up a small ToDo app with firebase integration.

`Blog Diary`

This is frontend application using local storage. Its main functionality is to record, edit and delete personal journals  or say notes. This project I started just to learn and understand the nitty gritties of Angular.js and how it works.

Yet to do: Create a backend server to store data on remote machines and access it on mobile platforms.

`Recipe web app`

I started this developing this app to learn and understand basics of web development and intricacies of server-client. I used MEAN stack for this product. I was successful in implementing a web server which serves POST, GET, PUT and DELETE methods to add, read, modify and delete recipes. I also developed a generic front end using Angular which can be used for basic blogging and apps like this recipe.

Yet to do: Integrate this server part and the front end, add authentication using passport.js to make it end-to-end usable.
