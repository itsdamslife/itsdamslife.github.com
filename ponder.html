    <h1>A thought - Discovering the Self and its relationship with GOD!</h1>

<ul style="font-size:20px">A Definition of God</ul>
<p style="font-size:18px">Modern man's concepts of God are many and varied. Children tend to
imagine an old man with a white beard. Many adults regard God as an
invisible force or a mental concept or as all humanity, the universe, or
even oneself.</p>

<ul style="font-size:18px">Who are you?</ul> 
<p style="font-size:18px">
Are you your body? Or your mind? Or are you something
higher? Do you know who you are, or do you merely think you know? And
does it really matter? Our materialistic society, with its unenlightened
leadership, has made it virtually taboo to inquire into our real, higher
self. Instead we use our valuable time maintaining, decorating, and
pampering the body for its own sake. Might there be an alternative?
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">
As far as the individual soul is concerned, it is originally a part
and parcel of the pleasure potency, of the reservoir of pleasure
Himself. However, due to contact with material nature, the soul has
forgotten its actual position and has become trapped in the evolutionary
process of transmigration from one body to another. Thus one struggles
hard for existence. Now we must extricate ourselves from the sufferings
of the struggle, from the countless transmigrations that force us to
suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease, and death, and come to
the point of our eternal life in GOD consciousness. That eternal life
is possible. If one tries his best in this human form of life, in his
next life he will get a spiritual body. The spiritual body is already
within the gross material body, but it will develop only as soon as one
becomes free from the contamination of this material existence. That is
the aim of human life and the actual self-interest of all people. Self-
interest is actually realizing, “I am part and parcel of God. I have to
return to the kingdom of God and join with Him.” Just as we have a
social life here, God has a social life in the spiritual kingdom, and we
can join Him there. It is not that after finishing this body we become
void.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px"><strong>
Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings, nor in the
future shall any of us cease to be. Our existence is therefore eternal,
and the changes of birth and death are simply the changes of the
temporary material bodies.
